#' Atmar & Patterson (1995) incidence matrices
#'
#' This is a list of site by species binary *incidence* (0 or 1) matrices. 
#' Note that after all cleaning procedures, the final number of matrices is 290 (not 294).
#' Each matrix in the list has a name that enables it to be linked back to the
#' original dataset in the publication.
