\title{Pearson tetrachoric correaltions for binary data}
\usage{
C_pears(m, clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Community data matrix with species as rows and sites as columns. Can
contain either incidences (1/0) or abundances (natural numbers).}

\item{clean}{Logical. Do you want to remove zero-sum rows or columns? When the index needs
the "d" fraction (sites where no species occurs), only zero-sum rows are removed.}
}
\value{
A dist or data.frame objects with the pairwise association values.
}
\description{
This is the index A_30 from Hubalek (1982), who considered it to be one of
the recommended indices.
Note: Before the calculation, species (rows) with zero occurrences are removed from m.
