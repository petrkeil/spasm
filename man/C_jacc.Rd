\title{Pairwise Jaccard associations among species in a community matrix}
\usage{
C_jacc(m, lst = FALSE, fun = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Community data matrix with species as rows and sites as columns. Can
contain either incidences (1/0) or abundances (natural numbers).}

\item{lst}{Should the results be returned as a 'dist' object (FALSE), or
as a 'data.frame' (TRUE)?}

\item{fun}{Additional function (e.g. log-transformation) to be applied
to all pairwise values.}
}
\value{
A dist or data.frame objects with the pairwise association values.
}
