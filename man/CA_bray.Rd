\title{Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix}
\usage{
CA_bray(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Community data matrix with species as rows and sites as columns. Can
contain either incidences (1/0) or abundances (natural numbers).}
}
\value{
A dist or data.frame objects with the pairwise values.
}
\description{
Calculates Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix for a community matrix.
This is a wrapper to a specific call to the 'vegdist' function in 'vegan'.
